            I guess if you had already pressed the back button you wouldn't be here still. 
            <br>
            <br>

        <a target="_blank" href="https://booth.pm/en">[Booth]</a> has a ton of different assets and whatnot you can buy or download for free! I bought my VRChat avatar from 					there. PayPal took care of the currency conversion!

        <a target="_blank" href="https://mountainofink.com/">[MountainOfInk]</a> If you're a fountain pen or dip pen user, you're probably interested in inks! This website  					 has most inks with tests and comparisons so you can find your next favorite ink without worry! I also recommend looking at <a target="_blank" href="https://inkswatch.com/index.html">[InkSwatch]</a> for more ink discovery!
