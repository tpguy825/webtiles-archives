    	<h1>Welcome to mine site</h1>
    	
    	<p>
    		It's a new site created in 9th February, 2026. I am still trying to navigate this coding shit, despite starting to hyperfixate on it around 2023 on Neocities that I've found out on SpaceHey... I've just found about NekoWeb on Perfectly Imperfect, trying to come back to hobby senses as I've stopped it around 2025... I have made so many sites on Neocities, so you might as well check them out in <b>Mine other sites</b> tab. I was also wandering around the "underground" internet since 2023 (due to will of detoxication from mainstream internet), so you can check out where else you can find me in <b>Where to find me?</b> tab. If you wanna know more about me before contacting me, read mine <b>Biography</b> if you feel shy to directly get to know me better. I'm also a (girl)blogger myself since I was 13 (ah those instablogger days...), so if you want, you can also check out my <b>Blog</b> tab. You also have a brief description about my content. And last, but not least... <b>Allies</b> tab, watch out for them because they have mine back... Just kidding. They're my mutuals and most of them are online... However, if you do not wish to be close, and still want to be mine acquaintained ally, you're always welcome to contact me to add you to that list.

    		This site looks bland because I have no time to work on my css skills. I'm in university at Philosophy major, currently 1st year. And because I have a lot of philosophical texts to read and deal with... And a lot of busy time to manage, a lot of people to help as well... I cannot make this site any more appealing for your eyes. So for now,,, Try to deal with this bland look. I mean... I'll try to add some images but... that's about it.
