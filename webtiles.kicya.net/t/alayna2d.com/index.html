                Before the development of Evergrace (subsequently referred to as EG), I had a certain idea in my mind. I wanted to create a sound that was, in a lot of ways, something I could hold to myself, and I think I have achieved that by composing the music of EG which also had its own unique worldview.
                    
          </p> <p style="font-style:italic">
I am also very grateful to the producer and everyone around me for allowing me to do what I wanted to do.
          </p> <p style="font-style:italic">
And with that, if people who listen to EG's soundtrack are able to feel the world of Evergrace, I would be very happy.

            Evergrace is a 2000 Action RPG launch title for the PS2 by Fromsoftware. It's an interesting game with an interesting OST. It's a little divisive. What do you think?
