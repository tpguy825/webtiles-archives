        <p> elma ♥ yorushika</p>
        <p>this is not my favourite yorushika album LOL but elma is my favourite character in ycu (yorushika cinematic universe) TM</p>
        <p>i think the story of the album, elma, is very profound. the album's titual character follows in the footsteps of amy, someone she admired and cared for greatly, literally. she visits the places he went before he died, dealing with the grief of his passing along the way. amy's companion album is titled "that's why i gave up on music". you can view the letters the characters sent to each other <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RV0pVn1bMPBrA6Bm-IfU7y-ZcksnsHjus7nnJ0gJ06g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.g3w5oyzcd9ld#heading=h.g3w5oyzcd9ld" target="_blank">here</a>. my favourite song in this album is ノーチラス (nautlius).</p>
            
            <p>
                if you'd like to listen to english covers, i reccomend rachie! she only covers one elma song-- a hole opened up in my heart. it's in her yorushika cover album "summer blooms without you", but please listen to the other songs! they are so, so amazing!!!
