            Released seven years after his debut album <i>Worlds</i>, <b>Nurture</b> is the second studio album by American electronic music producer Porter Robinson.

        <p>
            After the release of <i>Worlds</i>, Robinson would undergo "an intense period of depression and creative drought, where he struggled to overcome feelings of self-doubt and questioned whether he’d ever make music again." <a href="https://ourculturemag.com/2021/04/29/album-review-porter-robinson-nurture/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
