    <p>Hello, welcome, hello, welcome</p>
    <p>Nobody can die twice within a resonable time frame</p>
    <p>Have you ever wandered far enough to see your own reflection?</p>
    <p>It was nothing, wasn't it?</p>
    <p>Your ego eats away those you hold dear, but it isn't you.</p>
    <p>What's the point then?</p>
    <p>Maybe your screams will be mostly unheard, but it doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>Choose to experience life as much as long as you can.</p>
    <p>We cannot be sure there is anything else anyways.</p>
    <a href="index.html">Download free vbucks keygen torrent link 50 shades of gray anatomy, your mind is a tortured prison, yet it isn't, it's all of us, the prison is shared, but we cannot see each other, what is a nightmare but a reflection of the suffering we endure, it cannot filter the good and the bad, it only gives us our view, the subconscious reality we percieve, but as it is shared, it goes by all our rules, not just yours</a>
    <p>slime goobie doobie doo har har silly billy eats a carnillie lololololollolololololololollollololololololololol Why do you find me strange, is it not you who is strange for believing in a "normal", we all fall within the bounds that tie us together, each decision, each defect, our minds are shared, so are the interworkings, all performing ego checks as not to fall far from reality, it is not an ego check, i apologize, it's more of... Limitations, our minds only have so much capacity, so inevitably, our actions will hurt someone else, as hard as you try, someone will eventually die because of you, especially if you perform art. Isn't that fun? The world will take people away only because they need to. As a simple example, a proof that death exists, people had to die and get buried underground.</p>
