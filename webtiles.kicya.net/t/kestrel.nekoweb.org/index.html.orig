    <p>
       So, background-color on the body only for CSS, text wrapped in a p tag in the body only for visible HTML, there's no means of selecting a tile to be able to use chat, and /jump claims my Nekowebs site doesn't exist, even though it showed up just fine when making my account. RIP me, Ig. At least I've got my Nekoweb site and my Atabook working.
