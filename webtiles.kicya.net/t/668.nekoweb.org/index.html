		</p><p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me</p>
<p>I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed</p>
<p>She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb</p>
<p>In the shape of an "L" on her forehead</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming</p>
<p>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running</p>
<p>Didn't make sense not to live for fun</p>
<p>Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>So much to do, so much to see</p>
<p>So what's wrong with taking the back streets?</p>
<p>You'll never know if you don't go</p>
<p>You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play</p>
<p>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid</p>
<p>And all that glitters is gold</p>
<p>Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder</p>
<p>You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older</p>
<p>But the meteor man beg to differ</p>
<p>Judging by the hole in the satellite picture</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ice we skate is getting pretty thin</p>
<p>The water's getting warm so you might as well swim</p>
<p>My world's on fire. How about yours?</p>
<p>That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored</p>
<p> </p><p>
</p><p>Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play</p>
<p>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid</p>
<p>And all that glitters is gold</p>
<p>Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Go for the moon</p>
<p>Go for the moon</p>
<p>Go for the moon</p>
<p>Go for the moon</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play</p>
<p>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid</p>
<p>And all that glitters is gold</p>

<p>Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas</p>
<p>I need to get myself away from this place</p>
<p>I said yep, what a concept</p>
<p>I could use a little fuel myself</p>
<p>And we could all use a little change</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming</p>
<p>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running</p>
